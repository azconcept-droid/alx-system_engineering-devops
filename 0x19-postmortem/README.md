## Postmortem Report

### 1. Incident Summary
- **Date and Time of Incident**: June 10, 2024, 3:15 PM UTC
- **Duration**: 2 hours 45 minutes
- **Impact**: The incident caused the main application server to become unresponsive, affecting all users attempting to access the platform. Approximately 500,000 users experienced downtime.
- **Root Cause**: A memory leak in the application code caused the server to exhaust its available memory, leading to a system crash.

### 2. Timeline
- **Incident Detection**: 
  - 3:15 PM: Automatic monitoring alerts triggered due to high memory usage.
  - 3:20 PM: On-call engineer notified and began investigation.
- **Incident Response**: 
  - 3:25 PM: Initial diagnosis pointed to high memory usage.
  - 3:30 PM: Attempts to restart the server were made but failed due to persistent high memory usage.
  - 4:00 PM: Engineering team identified a memory leak in the new code deployment.
  - 4:30 PM: Rollback to the previous stable version initiated.
- **Resolution**: 
  - 5:45 PM: Rollback completed, server restarted successfully.
  - 6:00 PM: Monitoring confirmed system stability and normal operation resumed.
- **Post-Incident**: 
  - 6:15 PM: Engineering team conducted a debrief and documented the incident.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- **Technical Cause**: The memory leak was traced to a new feature that had been deployed earlier that day. A loop within the feature's code caused an accumulation of unused objects in memory, which were not being released properly.
- **Human Factors**: The issue was not caught during the code review process due to an oversight. Additionally, the new feature had insufficient load testing before deployment.
- **Process Issues**: The lack of comprehensive automated testing for memory leaks allowed the flawed code to be deployed to production.

### 4. Impact Analysis
- **Services Affected**: The main application server, affecting the entire user base.
- **User Impact**: All users (approximately 500,000) experienced an inability to access the application for the duration of the incident.
- **Business Impact**: Loss of revenue estimated at $50,000 due to service unavailability, along with potential damage to company reputation.

### 5. Resolution and Recovery
- **Immediate Fixes**: The server was rolled back to the previous stable version, which did not contain the memory leak.
- **Long-term Fixes**: 
  - Code review processes were enhanced to include checks for memory management.
  - Additional load and stress testing were implemented for new features.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Memory usage thresholds were adjusted, and additional alerts were set up for early detection of similar issues.

### 6. Lessons Learned
- **What Went Well**: The monitoring system quickly detected the issue, and the rollback process was executed efficiently.
- **What Went Wrong**: The memory leak was not detected during the code review or testing phases.
- **Gaps in Process**: Lack of comprehensive testing for memory leaks and insufficient load testing for new features.

### 7. Preventative Measures
- **Technical Changes**: 
  - Implemented automated memory leak detection tools in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Increased frequency and scope of load testing for all new features.
- **Process Changes**: Enhanced code review protocols to include memory management checks.
- **Training**: Conducted training sessions for the engineering team on best practices for memory management and detection of potential leaks.

### 8. Action Items
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Conduct post-incident review and debrief (Completed).
  - Rollback to stable version and ensure system stability (Completed).
- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Implement automated memory leak detection (Target: June 30, 2024).
  - Enhance code review and testing protocols (Target: July 15, 2024).
  - Schedule and conduct training sessions (Target: July 30, 2024).
- **Responsible Parties**:
  - Engineering Lead: John Doe
  - QA Manager: Jane Smith
  - Training Coordinator: Emily Johnson
- **Timeline for Completion**: All action items to be completed by July 30, 2024.

### 9. Sign-Off
- **Prepared by**: Michael Anderson
- **Reviewed by**: Sarah Thompson
- **Approved by**: Dr. Susan White
- **Date of Approval**: June 12, 2024
